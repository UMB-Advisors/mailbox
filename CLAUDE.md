## Project

**MailBox One — Email Agent Appliance**

A dedicated hardware appliance (Jetson Orin Nano Super) that runs an AI email agent for small CPG brand operators. The customer plugs in a box, connects their email, completes guided onboarding, and gets an always-on assistant that triages, drafts, and (with approval) sends email responses on their behalf. Sold as a managed product with white-glove onboarding and optional support subscription.

**Core Value:** Inbound operational email for small CPG brands gets triaged, drafted, and (with human approval) sent — without the founder spending 1-3 hours/day on email.

### Constraints

- **Hardware**: 8GB unified VRAM — local models limited to ~4B params quantized. NVMe storage: 500GB.
- **Power**: < 25W sustained under normal operation.
- **Latency**: Inbound email → draft in queue: < 30s local path, < 60s cloud path.
- **Boot time**: Cold boot to fully operational < 3 minutes.
- **Privacy**: All email content and knowledge base stored only on local appliance. No bulk corpus sent to cloud.
- **API provider**: Anthropic Claude (pooled Glue Co API key, billed to customer at cost + 20%).
- **Updates**: OTA via GitHub Container Registry (GHCR), customer-initiated only.
- **Phase 1 budget**: $800 (1 unit hardware + cloud API for testing).

## Technology Stack

> **As-built status (2026-05-01)** — this section reflects the live appliance, not aspirational recommendations. Customer #1 is at `mailbox.heronlabsinc.com`; customer #2 target 2026-05-20. Major divergences from the original STACK.md research doc are flagged with the relevant Decision Record (DR-NN).

### Core Technologies (live)
| Technology | Version | Purpose | Notes |
|------------|---------|---------|-------|
| Ollama | `dustynv/ollama:0.18.4-r36.4-cu126-22.04` | Local LLM inference server | JetPack 6 ARM64 CUDA image via `jetson-containers`. GPU passthrough via NVIDIA runtime. |
| Qdrant | 1.17.1 | Vector database for RAG | Deployed but not yet wired — Phase 2 RAG. `MALLOC_CONF=narenas:1` set per ARM64 jemalloc workaround (issue #4298). |
| n8n | **2.14.2** | Workflow runtime | Upgraded from `1.123.35` → `2.14.2` on 2026-05-01 (STAQPRO-181, supersedes DR-17). All 4 workflow JSONs (`MailBOX`, `MailBOX-Classify`, `MailBOX-Draft`, `MailBOX-Send`) re-import + activate cleanly in 2.x; validated against dev compose before prod cutover. **Ingress = Schedule (5 min) + Gmail Get** per DR-22 KILL of Pub/Sub push. No IMAP. |
| Postgres | 17-alpine | Operational datastore | Schema `mailbox`. Hosts n8n's `workflow_entity` table on the same DB. |
| Next.js 14 dashboard | App Router + Kysely | Approval queue UI + internal API routes | **DR-24**: dedicated Next.js service (`mailbox-dashboard`), not an Express+Vite SPA and not a Brain plugin. Internal routes: `/api/internal/{draft-prompt,draft-finalize,classification-prompt,classification-normalize,onboarding/live-gate,inbox-messages}` plus CRUD under `/api/drafts/...`. **Dashboard ORM ADR (2026-05-01)**: Kysely chosen over Prisma/Drizzle on Jetson hardware grounds. |
| Caddy | 2.x | Public HTTPS + auth gate | Cloudflare DNS-01 cert. `basic_auth` on **all paths** (`/dashboard/*`, `/`, `/webhook/*`) per **STAQPRO-131** + **STAQPRO-161**. The `/webhook/*` bypass that existed for the retired Pub/Sub push (DR-22 KILLED 2026-04-30) was removed; the dashboard's approve→send loop calls n8n via internal docker DNS (`http://n8n:5678/webhook/mailbox-send`) and never traverses Caddy. Bcrypt `$` chars need `$$` escaping in `.env`. |
### Models (live)
| Model | Pull Tag / Provider | Size (VRAM) | Purpose | Notes |
|-------|----------|------------|---------|-------|
| Qwen3-4B (custom ctx) | `qwen3:4b-ctx4k` (4096 ctx) | ~2.7 GB | Classifier + local drafter | Custom Modelfile to cap context at 4096 (DR-18). Routes via `LOCAL_CATEGORIES`: `reorder`, `scheduling`, `follow_up`, `internal`, `inquiry`. `/no_think` directive on classify path. |
| nomic-embed-text | `nomic-embed-text:v1.5` | 274 MB | RAG embeddings | Pulled but not yet wired (Phase 2 RAG). |
| gpt-oss:120b | Ollama Cloud (`ollama.com`) | — (cloud) | Cloud-escalation drafter — **default cloud model** | Per Eric's 2026-04-30 pivot superseding DR-23. Same `/api/chat` shape as local Ollama → swap baseUrl + key only. Routes via `CLOUD_CATEGORIES`: `escalate`, `unknown`, plus any `confidence < 0.75` safety net. |
| claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 | Anthropic API | — (cloud) | Alt-cloud fallback (config-ready, not active) | Wired via `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env; commented out in `.env.example` so the Ollama Cloud path is the live default. Switch by populating `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and pointing the draft route at the Anthropic provider. |
### Supporting Libraries (Dashboard Service — Next.js 14)
| Library | Version | Purpose | Notes |
|---------|---------|---------|-------|
| `next` | 14.2.x | Framework + dashboard runtime | App Router. Internal API routes under `app/api/**/route.ts`. |
| `pg` | ^8.13 | Postgres driver | Pool client wrapped in `dashboard/lib/db.ts`. The pool feeds Kysely (typed query surface) and is also exposed via `getPool()` for the migration runner, the `sql.raw` escape hatch, and test setup/teardown helpers. `setTypeParser(1184/1114)` overrides keep TIMESTAMP/TIMESTAMPTZ as strings — preserved across the Kysely path via codegen `--type-mapping`. |
| `kysely` | ^0.28.16 | Typed SQL query builder | **Adopted 2026-05-01** per the Dashboard ORM ADR. `getKysely()` returns `Kysely<DB>`; `DB` is generated by `kysely-codegen` into `dashboard/lib/db/schema.ts`. All `dashboard/lib/queries*.ts` helpers and route inline queries route through Kysely. `sql.raw` escape hatch available where raw SQL reads cleaner. |
| `kysely-codegen` | ^0.20.0 (devDep) | Schema introspection → TS types | Run via `npm run db:codegen` — bootstraps a temp postgres:17-alpine, applies `dashboard/test/fixtures/schema.sql`, generates `dashboard/lib/db/schema.ts`. CI verifies drift via `npm run db:codegen:verify`. Flags: `--dialect postgres --default-schema mailbox --include-pattern 'mailbox.*' --numeric-parser string --type-mapping '{"timestamp":"string","timestamptz":"string","date":"string"}'`. |
| Migrations | plain SQL files | Schema versioning | `dashboard/migrations/NNN-*.sql` ordered numerically; runner is `dashboard/migrations/runner.ts` (custom tsx script, no drizzle-kit, no prisma-migrate). Tracking table: `mailbox.migrations`. Compose service: `docker compose --profile migrate run mailbox-migrate`. |
| `zod` | ^4.4.1 | Runtime validation | Adopted in **STAQPRO-138** (shipped 2026-05-01). Schemas as plain `z.object({...})` in `dashboard/lib/schemas/` parsed by `dashboard/lib/middleware/validate.ts`. Routes use `parseJson(req, schema)` / `parseParams(params, schema)` — structured 400 on failure, narrow types on success. No ORM-derived schemas (Kysely doesn't emit them). |
| `tailwindcss` | 3.4.x | Utility CSS | Mobile-responsive dashboard. (Note: original STACK.md spec was Tailwind v4 + Vite 6 — DR-24 flipped to Next.js 14 which currently runs Tailwind v3.) |
### Development Tools
| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Docker (via JetsonHacks) | Container runtime | Install via JetsonHacks `install_nvidia_docker.sh` — installs whatever version is current and validated for the installed JetPack (currently 27.5.1). Do NOT use `docker-ce` from Docker Inc. — breaks NVIDIA runtime configuration paths on JetPack. Do NOT use `docker.io` directly — JetsonHacks handles NVIDIA runtime wiring automatically |
| `nvidia-container-toolkit` | GPU passthrough to containers | Install via `apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit` then `nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker`. Required for Ollama GPU access |
| `jetson-containers` (dusty-nv) | Validated container images | Use `autotag ollama` to get the correct JetPack-matched Ollama image. Eliminates CUDA/cuDNN version mismatch guesswork |
| `docker-compose` plugin | Orchestration | Use the Docker Compose v2 plugin (`docker compose`) not standalone `docker-compose` v1 (deprecated) |
| GHCR | OTA update registry | `ghcr.io` free for public images; multi-arch manifest push via `docker buildx` with `--platform linux/arm64` |
| `mkcert` | Local HTTPS | Optional: LAN HTTPS for dashboard if browser camera/mic permissions needed (not required for v1) |
## Installation
# --- Jetson host setup (run once after flash) ---
# Install Docker using JetsonHacks scripts (avoids broken docker-ce)
# Verify GPU passthrough
# --- Pull models via Ollama (after Docker Compose up) ---
# --- Dashboard dependencies ---
# --- React dashboard ---
## Docker Compose Service Config (critical settings)
## Alternatives Considered (historical)
| In use | Alternative | When alternative might apply |
|-------------|-------------|------------------------------|
| Ollama 0.18.x | llama.cpp direct | Only if needing GGUF features not yet in Ollama; Ollama adds ~50ms overhead but saves massive integration work |
| Qdrant | pgvector | Single-DB simplicity at < 100K vectors; pgvector is 3-4x slower on ANN. Phase 2 RAG decision. |
| n8n 2.14.2 | Custom Python orchestrator | Only if workflow logic becomes too complex for visual editing or n8n licensing becomes an issue. |
| Qwen3-4B (Q4_K_M, 4k ctx) | Llama-3.2-3B | Llama-3.2-3B is better for fine-tuning per distil labs; Qwen3-4B wins out-of-the-box classification. We re-tested 2026-04-30; Qwen3 stays. |
| nomic-embed-text v1.5 | nomic-embed-text-v2-moe | v2-moe is 475M params (vs 137M); creates memory pressure alongside Qwen3-4B on 8GB unified RAM. |
| Ollama Cloud `gpt-oss:120b` | Anthropic Haiku 4.5 | Both wired; same Ollama-shape API. Haiku is config-ready alt-cloud — flip by populating `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Per 2026-04-30 pivot. |
| Next.js 14 dashboard | Express + Vite SPA | Original STACK.md spec; **flipped to Next.js per DR-24** (single service, App Router internal API routes, easier OAuth-callback patterns). |
| Kysely (pure-TS query builder) over raw pg.Pool | Drizzle / Prisma | **2026-05-01 Dashboard ORM ADR** (supersedes the 2026-04-27 ADR's "Drizzle as MVP target" half). Prisma rejected on Jetson grounds: separate Rust query-engine sidecar process (~80-150MB resident on ARM64) plus migration-tooling fight with the existing 8 hand-authored `.sql` migrations plus type cascade through 14 zod schemas (Prisma emits Date for TIMESTAMP; pg type-parser overrides force string). Drizzle rejected as redundant churn — its main value is its schema DSL, but our hand-written `.sql` migrations are an asset, not a liability. Kysely's `kysely-codegen` introspects the canonical schema snapshot and emits typed DB row shapes into `dashboard/lib/db/schema.ts`; `--type-mapping` flags preserve the timestamp/numeric-as-string convention end-to-end. |
## What NOT to Use
| Avoid | Why | Use Instead |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| `docker-ce` (Docker Inc. repo) | Breaks NVIDIA runtime configuration paths on JetPack — GPU passthrough stops working | JetsonHacks `install_nvidia_docker.sh` |
| Mistral-7B or any 7B+ local model | 7B Q4_K_M needs ~4.5GB VRAM; leaves < 3.5GB for embeddings + system on 8GB unified RAM | Qwen3-4B (Q4_K_M, ~2.7GB, 4k ctx) |
| IMAP polling / SMTP send | The DR-22 KILL settled on n8n's Gmail Get + Gmail Reply nodes via OAuth (refresh token in n8n's encrypted credential store). No `imapflow` or `nodemailer` dependency. | Gmail Get + Gmail Reply (n8n nodes, OAuth via the appliance) |
| Pub/Sub push ingress | **DR-22 KILLED 2026-04-30** by Linus/Liotta/Neo consensus. Eliminates GCP project, watch renewal cron, and public webhook attack surface. | Schedule trigger (5 min) + Gmail Get polling |
| `docker-compose` v1 (standalone binary) | Deprecated upstream | Docker Compose v2 plugin (`docker compose`) |
| Auto-updating `:latest` tags in production | Silent breakage on OTA at a customer site is a support incident | Pin all service images to specific tags or digests; OTA via GHCR with controlled rollout |
| Langchain/LlamaIndex inside n8n | Duplicates what n8n already does natively; adds Python runtime dependency | n8n built-in AI Agent + Ollama Model nodes |
## Stack Patterns by Variant
- Use `jetson-containers run $(autotag ollama)` instead of `docker run ollama/ollama`
- The `autotag` command resolves the JetPack-matched image (e.g., `r36.4.0` for JetPack 6.2)
- Check logs for `Nvidia GPU detected via cudart` — absence means toolkit is misconfigured
- This is a known open issue (GitHub #4298, open as of Nov 2025)
- Workaround: set `environment: - MALLOC_CONF=narenas:1` in docker-compose
- If that fails, build from source on-device: `cargo build --release` with `JEMALLOC_SYS_WITH_LG_PAGE=16`
- The official multi-arch image (`qdrant/qdrant:v1.17.1`) includes the `-arm64` tag variant; pull explicitly with `docker pull qdrant/qdrant:v1.17.1-arm64` if the manifest auto-select fails
- MEDIUM confidence on workaround reliability — test in Phase 1 sprint 1
- The n8n Anthropic Chat Model node accepts any model ID string as a custom value
- Set model to `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` manually — n8n passes it directly to the API
- Qwen3 can toggle between thinking (chain-of-thought) and non-thinking mode
- For classification tasks (latency-sensitive), add `/no_think` system prompt directive
- For draft generation, thinking mode is acceptable (< 60s cloud SLA has headroom)
- Rollback procedure: `docker compose pull [service]@[previous-digest]`
- Pin digests not just versions: `qdrant/qdrant@sha256:...` in production compose file
- Pre-pull new image before stopping old container to minimize downtime
## Version Compatibility
| Package | Compatible With | Notes |
|---------|-----------------|-------|
| JetPack 6.2 (L4T r36.4) | Ollama 0.18.x+, CUDA 12.x | JetPack 6.2 introduced "Super Mode" which unlocks full 40 TOPS on Orin Nano Super — requires JetPack 6.2 specifically, not 6.0/6.1 |
| Docker 27.5.1 (via JetsonHacks) | nvidia-container-toolkit 1.17.x | Installed by JetsonHacks `install_nvidia_docker.sh`; version is managed by JetsonHacks and may advance. Always verify GPU passthrough after install with `docker run --rm --runtime nvidia nvidia/cuda:12.3.0-base-ubuntu22.04 nvidia-smi` |
| n8n 2.x | Postgres 13+ | n8n 2.0 dropped support for SQLite in multi-user mode; use Postgres 17 |
| n8n 2.x | Node.js 20+ (inside container) | n8n's Docker image ships its own Node.js; no host Node.js needed |
| Qdrant 1.17.x | `@qdrant/js-client-rest` ^1.11 | The JS client REST version should match the server major version; 1.17 server is API-compatible with 1.11 client |
| Qwen3-4B (Q4_K_M) | Ollama 0.6.0+ | Qwen3 family requires Ollama 0.6.0+ for proper tokenizer support; 0.18.x is well above this floor |
| nomic-embed-text:v1.5 | Ollama 0.1.26+ | Requires Ollama 0.1.26 per official library page |
| React 18 | Node.js 18+ (build time) | React 18 concurrent features require Node.js 18+; build happens on dev machine or CI, not on Jetson |
| Tailwind CSS v4 | Vite 6.x | Tailwind v4 requires Vite 6+ via the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin (replaces PostCSS config) |
## Memory Budget (8GB Unified VRAM)
| Component | Typical Footprint | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|-------|
| Ubuntu 22.04 + JetPack 6.2 OS | ~1.5 GB | Baseline with Docker daemon running |
| Ollama daemon (no model loaded) | ~150 MB | |
| Qwen3-4B Q4_K_M (loaded) | ~2.7 GB | Stays loaded while processing emails |
| nomic-embed-text:v1.5 (loaded) | ~350 MB | May unload between RAG operations; Ollama LRU cache |
| Qdrant | ~200-400 MB | Depends on vector count; 10K emails ≈ 100MB index |
| n8n | ~300 MB | Node.js process; 2.x is more memory efficient than 1.x |
| Postgres | ~100 MB | Small operational DB; not analytics |
| Dashboard (nginx + Express) | ~100 MB | Static files via nginx + Express API |
| **Total estimate** | **~5.7 GB** | **~2.3 GB headroom for bursts and OS cache** |

## Conventions

### Draft status state machine
`mailbox.drafts.status` lifecycle (live CHECK constraint): `pending` → `awaiting_cloud` (when route is `CLOUD_CATEGORIES` and the cloud call is in flight) → (`approved` | `rejected` | `edited`) → (`sent` | `failed`). Source of truth for the enum is the Postgres CHECK constraint defined in `dashboard/migrations/003-evolve-drafts-to-queue-shape-v1-2026-04-27.sql` (and later widened by 008). Route handlers must import a single TS constant for the enum (planned home: `dashboard/lib/types.ts`), not redeclare string literals — this is what STAQPRO-137 will consolidate.

`drafts.draft_source` (live CHECK constraint): `local` | `cloud` | `local_qwen3` | `cloud_haiku`. Current code populates `local` or `cloud` (the route, not the model); the actual model used is recorded in `drafts.model` (e.g. `qwen3:4b-ctx4k`, `gpt-oss:120b`, `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`). The `local_qwen3` / `cloud_haiku` qualified values exist in the constraint as historical-compatibility carry-overs from earlier migrations but are not the values written by the live drafting path.

### `inbox_messages` denormalization
`mailbox.inbox_messages` carries its own `classification`, `confidence`, `classified_at`, `model`, `draft_id` columns alongside the per-draft state in `mailbox.drafts`. Treat `inbox_messages` as the message-level snapshot of the latest classification + currently linked draft. `mailbox.classification_log` is the append-only history.

### Route handler pattern
All API handlers under `dashboard/app/api/**/route.ts` follow the App Router contract: export named handlers (`GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`) that accept `(request: Request, { params })` and return a `Response`. Internal routes (`/api/internal/*`) are not auth-gated by Caddy basic_auth — they're called from n8n inside the docker network. **STAQPRO-138 is in flight**: replace inline `typeof x !== 'string'` checks with zod schemas in `dashboard/lib/schemas/` parsed by a shared validate middleware (`dashboard/lib/middleware/validate.ts`).

### SQL convention
Hand-rolled SQL via `pg.Pool` from `dashboard/lib/db.ts`. Two surface patterns: (a) named query helpers in `dashboard/lib/queries*.ts` (preferred — keeps SQL out of route handlers and gives them a typed surface) and (b) inline `pool.query(sql, params)` calls inside a route file when the query is one-off. **Direction**: when the same SQL gets used by 2+ routes, promote it into `lib/queries*.ts`. Always parameterize — never string-concatenate user input into SQL.

### Comment standard (migration files)
Per migration 007 (the first migration to land the standard): every migration file opens with a 2-3 line block comment stating (i) what the migration changes, (ii) why (link the Linear issue or DR), and (iii) any reversal/rollback note. Schema-touching SQL only — no DML in migrations unless specifically called out as a backfill.

### `.env` escaping
Bcrypt hashes (used by Caddy `basic_auth` for `MAILBOX_BASIC_AUTH_HASH`) contain literal `$` characters. Docker Compose treats `$` as variable expansion and silently truncates values at the `$`. **Escape every `$` to `$$` in `.env`** or your hash will be empty inside the container. This bit us on the first Caddy deploy.

### n8n workflow editing
- Sub-workflows that are invoked via `executeWorkflowTrigger` should have `active: false`. n8n's "no native trigger" activation check otherwise emits cosmetic but loud "could not activate" errors every restart.
- `n8n update:workflow --active=...` is a NO-OP at runtime unless the n8n container is restarted. The flag persists to the DB but the live runtime keeps the old activation state cached.
- `Insert Inbox (skip dupes)` with no Gmail returns produces an empty `$json` that still fires `Run Classify Sub` once. That's why empty 5-min cycles error harmlessly at `Load Inbox Row`. Pre-existing, benign, but confusing if not explained.

## Architecture

### Service topology (8-service Docker Compose stack on Jetson)

| Service | Image | Role |
|---------|-------|------|
| `postgres` | `postgres:17-alpine` | Operational DB (`mailbox` schema) + n8n's `workflow_entity` table |
| `qdrant` | `qdrant/qdrant:v1.17.1` | Vector store (deployed, Phase 2 RAG — not yet wired) |
| `ollama` | `dustynv/ollama:0.18.4-r36.4-cu126-22.04` | Local LLM inference (Qwen3-4B classifier + drafter, nomic-embed-text) |
| `n8n` | `n8nio/n8n:2.14.2` | Workflow runtime; sub-workflows: `MailBOX`, `MailBOX-Classify`, `MailBOX-Draft`, `MailBOX-Send` |
| `caddy` | `caddy:2` | Public HTTPS via Cloudflare DNS-01; basic_auth on all paths (incl. `/webhook/*` per STAQPRO-161 — bypass removed post-DR-22) |
| `mailbox-dashboard` | Next.js 14 build | Approval queue UI + internal API routes (DR-24) |
| `mailbox-migrate` | Custom tsx migration runner | `docker compose --profile migrate run mailbox-migrate` — runs `dashboard/migrations/runner.ts` against the `mailbox.migrations` tracking table, applies un-applied `.sql` files in numeric order |

**Operator shell access**: Tailscale SSH only (`tailscale ssh bob@<tailnet-host>`). The previously-deployed `ttyd` browser terminal was removed 2026-05-01 per STAQPRO-126 (NC-27) — basic_auth-per-device didn't scale across N customers. Tailscale is identity-based; revoking a user removes shell access from every appliance instantly.

### Routing rules (`dashboard/lib/classification/prompt.ts:routeFor`)

- `spam_marketing` → drop (no draft created)
- `confidence < 0.75` → cloud (safety net)
- `LOCAL_CATEGORIES` (`reorder`, `scheduling`, `follow_up`, `internal`, `inquiry`) → local Qwen3
- `CLOUD_CATEGORIES` (`escalate`, `unknown`) → Ollama Cloud (`gpt-oss:120b` default; `OLLAMA_CLOUD_MODEL` env override)

### Active decision records

| DR | Decision | Status |
|----|----------|--------|
| DR-17 | Pin n8n to `1.123.35` (avoid 2.x migration for MVP) | **Superseded 2026-05-01 (STAQPRO-181)** — upgraded to `2.14.2` after dev-compose validation confirmed all 4 workflow JSONs re-import + activate cleanly |
| DR-18 | `qwen3:4b-ctx4k` @ 4096 ctx as T2 default | Active |
| DR-22 | Pub/Sub push as Phase 1 ingress | **KILLED 2026-04-30** — stay polling |
| DR-23 | Anthropic Haiku 4.5 as primary cloud draft model | **SUPERSEDED 2026-04-30** — Ollama Cloud `gpt-oss:120b` is default; Haiku is config-ready alt |

### Public surface (customer #1, `mailbox.heronlabsinc.com`)

- `https://mailbox.heronlabsinc.com/dashboard/queue` — approval queue (basic_auth gated per STAQPRO-131)
- `https://mailbox.heronlabsinc.com/` — n8n editor (basic_auth gated)
- `https://mailbox.heronlabsinc.com/webhook/*` — n8n webhook ingress (basic_auth gated per STAQPRO-161; the dashboard's approve→send loop bypasses Caddy via internal docker DNS at `http://n8n:5678/webhook/mailbox-send`)

### Test coverage

**STAQPRO-133 (open)** — there are no Vitest tests yet. The existing `scripts/smoke-test.sh` is **infrastructure** smoke (GPU, Qdrant, Postgres) — it does not exercise the pipeline. Pipeline + schema + route tests are scheduled to land before customer #2.

## GSD Workflow Enforcement

Before using Edit, Write, or other file-changing tools, start work through a GSD command so planning artifacts and execution context stay in sync.

Use these entry points:
- `/gsd:quick` for small fixes, doc updates, and ad-hoc tasks
- `/gsd:debug` for investigation and bug fixing
- `/gsd:execute-phase` for planned phase work

Do not make direct repo edits outside a GSD workflow unless the user explicitly asks to bypass it.

## Developer Profile

> Profile not yet configured. Run `/gsd:profile-user` to generate your developer profile.
> This section is managed by `generate-claude-profile` -- do not edit manually.

## Deployment Target

The appliance is reachable from this workstation via SSH alias `jetson`
(direct ethernet at `10.42.0.2`, user `bob`). A fallback alias `jetson-wifi`
points at the LAN IP `192.168.1.45` for use when the direct cable isn't
available. The Jetson runs the deployed code from `/home/bob/mailbox/` —
same git remote as this local clone.

The direct ethernet link uses an isolated `10.42.0.0/24` subnet (workstation
`10.42.0.1`, Jetson `10.42.0.2`) and provides ~0.5ms RTT vs Wi-Fi's typical
5-30ms. Configured statically via NetworkManager profiles ("jetson-direct"
on the workstation, "Wired connection 1" on the Jetson).

### Reading appliance state

- Container status: `ssh jetson 'cd ~/mailbox && docker compose ps'`
- Service logs: `ssh jetson 'docker logs <service> --tail 50'`
- Live config: `ssh jetson 'cat /home/bob/mailbox/<path>'`
- Health probes: `ssh jetson 'docker compose -f ~/mailbox/docker-compose.yml exec <svc> <cmd>'`

### Deploy flow

This local clone is the source of truth. Edit here, commit, push, then on the Jetson: pull and reload.

    # On this workstation
    git add . && git commit -m "..." && git push origin master

    # Apply on the Jetson (one-liner from this workstation)
    ssh jetson 'cd ~/mailbox && git pull && docker compose up -d --build --remove-orphans'

**Always pass `--remove-orphans`** on full-stack `up` calls. When a service is removed from `docker-compose.yml` (e.g., the ttyd removal in STAQPRO-182), the running container becomes an orphan and keeps its host port binding — `--remove-orphans` cleans it up automatically. Without it, you'll see `docker compose down <service>` return "no such service" while the container is still listening.

For Caddy-only or config-only changes (no rebuild), restart the container:

    ssh jetson 'cd ~/mailbox && git pull && docker compose restart caddy'

Don't use `docker compose exec caddy caddy reload --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile` — STAQPRO-161 deploy hit a case where the admin-API reload reported "config is unchanged" and kept the old config loaded even though the bind-mounted Caddyfile on the host had the new content. Full container restart re-reads the bind mount cleanly. Cost is ~1s of dropped connections vs the silent stale-config trap.

### Public surface

- Dashboard: `https://mailbox.heronlabsinc.com/dashboard/queue`
- n8n editor: behind LAN-only access at `http://192.168.1.45:5678`
- Ollama API: `http://192.168.1.45:11434` (LAN only)
- Qdrant: `http://192.168.1.45:6333` (LAN only)

### Tailscale access

Both Jetsons live on the shared `consultingfutures@gmail.com` tailnet
(MagicDNS suffix `tail377a9a.ts.net`). Two SSH aliases in `~/.ssh/config`:

| Alias              | Tailnet host                            | IPv4           | Box                                   |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------|
| `jetson-tailscale` | `mailbox-jetson-01.tail377a9a.ts.net`   | `100.65.9.2`   | Local Jetson (alternative to `10.42.0.2` direct ethernet) |
| `jetson-dustin`    | `bob-tb250-btc.tail377a9a.ts.net`       | `100.65.26.125`| Dustin's Jetson                       |

Both run as user `bob` with identical `/home/bob/mailbox/` layout, so every
command in "Reading appliance state" / "Deploy flow" works against either by
swapping the alias.

LAN-only services on his box are reachable via the tailnet hostname
(provided the compose port bindings are `0.0.0.0`, not `127.0.0.1`):

- Dashboard direct: `http://bob-tb250-btc.tail377a9a.ts.net:3001/dashboard/queue`
- n8n editor: `http://bob-tb250-btc.tail377a9a.ts.net:5678`
- Ollama API: `http://bob-tb250-btc.tail377a9a.ts.net:11434`
- Qdrant: `http://bob-tb250-btc.tail377a9a.ts.net:6333`

Fallback if a port is bound to localhost only:

    ssh -L 5678:localhost:5678 jetson-dustin

#### "Connection refused" on `ssh jetson-dustin`

If `tailscale ping bob-tb250-btc` succeeds but `ssh` returns connection
refused, the tailnet is fine — sshd is the problem. Have Dustin run on his
Jetson:

    sudo systemctl enable --now ssh
    sudo systemctl status ssh

Or enable Tailscale SSH (no key copy needed, ACL-gated):

    sudo tailscale up --ssh

Then add this workstation's `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` to
`/home/bob/.ssh/authorized_keys` on his box (or rely on Tailscale SSH).
