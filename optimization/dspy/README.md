# `optimization/dspy/` — DSPy GEPA prompt optimizer

STAQPRO-343. Offline prompt-optimization toolchain for the MailBox One
drafting pipeline. Lives in this repo because it's tightly coupled to the
trace-set abstraction (`dashboard/lib/eval/trace-set.ts`) and to the live
prompt files (`dashboard/lib/{classification,drafting}/prompt.ts`).

**This is operator-run tooling, not appliance runtime.** Nothing here ships
to mailbox1 / mailbox2; the only artifacts that propagate to the appliance
are the compiled prompt templates an operator chooses to copy out of
`outputs/` into the persona / n8n config (a manual step outside this PR's
scope).

## What's in here

- `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock` — Python toolchain pinned to DSPy 2.x.
- `signatures.py` — DSPy signatures for `ClassifyAndFile` + `DraftReply`,
  mirroring `dashboard/lib/{classification,drafting}/prompt.ts`.
- `metric.py` — Ollama Cloud `gpt-oss:120b` LLM-as-judge metric (primary)
  + nomic-embed cosine sanity floor (secondary). Returns 0/1 win per
  `(candidate, reference)` pair. Same endpoint + auth as the live
  alt-cloud drafter (DR-23 supersede) — different family than the Qwen3
  baseline drafter to avoid same-model-as-judge bias.
- `trace_set.py` — Pydantic mirror of the canonical TS trace-set schema
  with SHA-256 verification. Source of truth: `dashboard/lib/eval/trace-set.ts`.
- `optimize.py` — CLI entry point. Loads traces, splits train/val, runs
  GEPA, emits `program.json` + portable prompt YAML + report.md.
- `tests/` — pytest coverage for the trace loader, signatures, and metric
  parsing (judge is mocked; no live cloud calls in CI).
- `outputs/` — gitignored. GEPA runs write here.
- `prompts/` — committed. Templates portable to n8n / persona system land
  here after operator review of an `outputs/` run.

## Privacy stance

- Trace JSONL files live in `traces/` (also gitignored) — they contain
  PII-scrubbed customer email bodies but still embed real sender names and
  email addresses per the STAQPRO-193 locked decision. Treat as
  customer-private; never commit, never publish.
- The Ollama Cloud `gpt-oss:120b` judge call sends individual
  `(candidate, reference, inbound)` triples to `https://ollama.com/api/chat`.
  This is inside the existing cloud trust boundary — the live drafter
  already escalates to the same endpoint on the cloud route per DR-23 —
  but you should still gate runs behind operator approval.
- The portable prompt YAML in `prompts/` (or in `outputs/<run>/prompt-*.yaml`)
  is **instructions only**, no few-shot demos. The optimizer deliberately
  strips compiled demonstrations because those may quote real customer
  email fragments verbatim. Operator must eyeball any YAML before copying
  out of `outputs/` into the committed `prompts/` directory.

## Operator runbook

### One-time setup

```bash
cd optimization/dspy
uv sync                                # materializes .venv from uv.lock
export OLLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY=...        # required for judge + reflection LM
# Same key as the live appliance's `.env` OLLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY (the
# alt-cloud drafter path per DR-23). Pull from 1Password if you don't have
# it locally; never commit.
```

### Fetch a real trace set from an appliance

Real customer email content materializes only on the appliances. To run
GEPA against real data, build a trace set on the box and scp it back to
the workstation. Delete the local copy when you're done.

```bash
# On the workstation — open a Postgres tunnel for the build script.
# (Equivalent to `ssh -L 5432:localhost:5432 mailbox1` then running the
# build-trace-set.ts CLI inside the dashboard container; see
# dashboard/scripts/build-trace-set.ts for the canonical procedure.)
ssh mailbox1 'docker exec -e POSTGRES_URL=$(grep ^POSTGRES_URL /home/bob/mailbox/.env | cut -d= -f2-) \
  mailbox-dashboard npx tsx scripts/build-trace-set.ts \
  --out /tmp/trace-set/v1.0 \
  --set-version v1.0 \
  --appliance mailbox1 \
  --limit 100'

# Pull it back.
mkdir -p optimization/dspy/traces/v1.0
scp -r mailbox1:/tmp/trace-set/v1.0/* optimization/dspy/traces/v1.0/

# Clean up the on-appliance copy.
ssh mailbox1 'rm -rf /tmp/trace-set'
```

### Run optimization

```bash
cd optimization/dspy
uv run python -m optimize \
  --trace-set ./traces/v1.0 \
  --target-base-url http://localhost:11434 \
  --target-model qwen3:4b-ctx4k \
  --out outputs/run-$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%S) \
  --auto light
```

Bottom-line numbers (PRE / POST / LIFT) print at the end. The full report
+ compiled program + portable prompt YAML land in `outputs/<run>/`.

For the target model, point at any OpenAI-compatible endpoint:

- Local Qwen3 on the workstation if you've pulled the model there.
- The appliance Ollama via SSH tunnel: `ssh -L 11434:localhost:11434 mailbox1`.
- Ollama Cloud for `gpt-oss:120b` (second-pass; out of scope for v0.1).

### Clean up after a run

```bash
# Trace JSONL is gitignored but lives on disk — wipe when done.
rm -rf optimization/dspy/traces/
```

## Testing

```bash
cd optimization/dspy
uv run pytest
```

Tests cover:

- Trace loader: parsing the example manifest, schema validation, SHA-256
  verification.
- Signatures: enum parity with `dashboard/lib/classification/prompt.ts`.
- Metric: judge response parsing (mocked Ollama Cloud `/api/chat`), wire
  shape (URL, Bearer auth, model), cosine math, empty candidate handling.

No live cloud calls are made in CI — the judge's `httpx.Client` is
swapped for a `MagicMock` after construction and nomic-embed is bypassed
via `disable_cosine=True`.

## Scope notes (STAQPRO-343 v0.1)

- **Signatures shipped:** `ClassifyAndFile`, `DraftReply`. The stretch
  signatures (`summarize-thread`, `escalate-to-human`) are deferred — the
  trace-set v1.0 spec emits `draft-reply` rows only.
- **Target models:** Qwen3-4B (current production drafter) is the v0.1
  first-pass target. Second-pass against the STAQPRO-342 bake-off winner
  is out of scope for this PR — that issue hasn't completed.
- **Trace-fetch path:** option (b) per the foreman audit — ship the
  harness, document the operator runbook above for fetching a real trace
  set. No real traces materialize in this PR; first real GEPA run is an
  operator follow-up.

## Run-1 baseline (2026-05-14, mailbox1 v1.0 trace set)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Run dir (gitignored) | `outputs/run-1-baseline-2026-05-14/` |
| Trace set | `traces/v1.0` (100 traces from mailbox1) |
| Set SHA-256 | `d8d040ba5ee06933425e794b7c81c20f9938ffb2c35f4f531d2f7eed30799d04` |
| Split | train=50, val=50, seed=1 |
| Target | `qwen3:4b-ctx4k` @ `http://localhost:11434` |
| Judge | `gpt-oss:120b` @ Ollama Cloud |
| GEPA budget | `--auto light` (≈580 metric calls, 2h21m wall-clock) |
| **PRE win rate** | **0.000** (full valset) |
| **POST win rate** | **0.000** |
| **Lift** | **+0.000** |

The compiled `prompt-draft-reply.yaml` is byte-identical to the baseline
instructions — GEPA proposed ≥5 mutations and the judge scored every
one at 0.0, so GEPA correctly skipped all of them per its
"new-score must beat old-score to be accepted" rule.

**This is a real data point, not a measurement artifact.** GEPA's
Iteration-0 base-program full-valset eval registered 0.0/50 *before*
the run hit any Ollama Cloud rate-limit pressure (the 428 of 580
`429 Too Many Requests` failures concentrated in post-eval at the
tail). With baseline = 0.0, GEPA has no positive signal to gradient
against, so every reflective mutation also returns 0.0 and the search
collapses to "no change."

The next-steps follow-ups are about the **metric + corpus**, not GEPA
itself:

1. **Judge prompt is structurally too strict.** Pairwise win-rate is
   defined as `candidate ≥ reference` on three axes (intent +
   actionability + tone-match). Real-world references are often short,
   conversational, sometimes literal forwarded-message chains
   ("`---------- Forwarded message --------- From: …`"). Qwen3-4B's
   default-prompt candidates are longer and more corporate. On the
   *tone-match* axis the operator-written reference is treated as
   canonical, so any rewrite — however semantically equivalent — fails
   the `≥` test. The metric needs to relax to *"non-regressive on
   intent + no fabrication"* rather than strict majority-vote-≥ on three
   axes. Tracked separately (see Linear: judge-relax follow-up on
   STAQPRO-340).
2. **Trace corpus has forwarded-mail and duplicate-inbound rows.** The
   v1.0 builder (`dashboard/scripts/build-trace-set.ts`) joins
   `sent_history` rows with `source='backfill'` 1:1 to `inbox_messages`
   on `inbox_message_id`. For inbounds that the operator forwarded
   *and* replied to (or replied multiple times), the inbound appears in
   multiple traces with different `actual_reply_body` values. The
   target model deterministically produces the same candidate for the
   same prompt, so the metric scores those duplicates against
   different "ground truths" — diluting signal. The builder should
   filter forwarded-only replies and pick one canonical reply per
   inbound. Tracked separately on STAQPRO-340.
3. **Ollama Cloud 429 rate-limit handling.** The judge HTTP client
   currently has no retry/backoff — a 429 becomes an immediate
   `0` score for that example. Add exponential backoff with jitter
   inside `metric.JudgeMetric._call_judge`. Tracked separately.

**Conclusion for M5 sequencing:** the +0.000 lift is the honest answer
under the current v0.1 metric + v1.0 corpus. Read it as: *prompt
optimization alone does not move the Qwen3-4B-ctx4k draft-quality
needle when evaluated against the operator's actual sent replies.*
For STAQPRO-342 (three-way bake-off) this is useful: it suggests
architectural model lift, not prompt lift, is where Phase 2 win-rate
improvements live. The two follow-ups above will tell us whether a
relaxed metric + a cleaner corpus would surface prompt-level lift on
the bake-off winner.

## Run-2 (STAQPRO-363 — relaxed metric + 429 retry, 2026-05-15)

**Status: completed 2026-05-15.** The metric module landed the
STAQPRO-363 changes (relaxed judge prompt, cosine sanity floor flipped
to opt-in, 429 retry/backoff with jitter + clamped `Retry-After` +
structured `JudgeError("rate_limited")` on exhaustion). Smoke gate
passed (ref-vs-ref 0.80, clearly-bad 0.00, baseline 0.20). GEPA was
re-fired against the same `traces/v1.0` set. Numbers in the table
below; verdict at the end of this section.

### Pre-flight smoke (cheap, ~30 cloud calls)

Before spending another `--auto light` budget (~580 cloud calls,
~2h21m wall-clock), confirm the relaxed judge is discriminative:

```bash
cd optimization/dspy
uv run python scripts/judge_discriminative_smoke.py \
    --trace-set ./traces/v1.0 \
    --n 10
```

Pass criteria (exits non-zero on failure):

* `reference-vs-reference` mean ≥ 0.80 — judge accepts operator-approved
  replies when fed them as candidates.
* `clearly-bad` mean = 0.00 — judge rejects an off-topic, fabricating
  candidate every time.
* `baseline (truncated)` — informational, no threshold; should land
  somewhere in between as a sanity signal.

If `reference-vs-reference < 0.80`, the prompt needs another pass
before burning a full GEPA budget — STOP, don't proceed.

### Run-2 invocation

After smoke passes:

```bash
cd optimization/dspy
uv run python -m optimize \
    --trace-set ./traces/v1.0 \
    --target-base-url http://localhost:11434 \
    --target-model qwen3:4b-ctx4k \
    --out outputs/run-2-relaxed-judge-$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%S) \
    --auto light
```

Cosine floor stays off (the STAQPRO-363 default). Pass `--cos-floor 0.30`
only for a diagnostic A/B against Run-1's gating behavior.

### Run-2 results

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Run dir (gitignored) | `outputs/run-2-relaxed-judge-20260516T012838Z/` |
| Trace set | `traces/v1.0` (same as Run-1) |
| Set SHA-256 | `d8d040ba5ee06933425e794b7c81c20f9938ffb2c35f4f531d2f7eed30799d04` |
| Split | train=50, val=50, seed=1 (unchanged) |
| Target | `qwen3:4b-ctx4k` @ `http://localhost:11434` |
| Judge | `gpt-oss:120b` @ Ollama Cloud (relaxed prompt + 429 retry) |
| GEPA budget | `--auto light` (≈580 metric calls; 100 min wall-clock vs Run-1's 141 min — the cosine-floor skip on the default path saves the embed round-trips) |
| **PRE win rate** | **0.000** (full valset) |
| **POST win rate** | **0.000** |
| **Lift** | **+0.000** |
| Judge 429-exhaustion rate | **296/≈580 ≈ 51.0%** (down from Run-1's 428/580 = 73.8%, a 22.8-pp drop) |
| `JudgeError("rate_limited")` count | 296 (calls that exhausted 4 retries and were scored 0.0) |
| Retry recovery rate | 1/297 ≈ 0.34% (only 1 of 297 calls that entered the retry path eventually got a 200; the cloud rate-limit is sustained, not bursty, so exponential backoff alone doesn't recover most stalled calls) |
| GEPA iterations | 109 attempted, 0 accepted (every mutation scored 0.0; selected program 0 every iteration) |
| Compiled `prompt-draft-reply.yaml` | byte-identical to the seed `signatures.py` instructions (same outcome as Run-1) |

### Run-2 verdict

The relaxed-metric + retry/backoff changes worked as designed but did
not move the lift. The 429-exhaustion rate fell ~23 pp (73.8% → 51.0%),
confirming the retry path takes pressure off Ollama Cloud, but only
1/297 retry-path calls actually recovered to a 200 — the cloud
rate-limit on `gpt-oss:120b` is sustained, not bursty, so exponential
backoff alone is the wrong tool. More importantly, the win rate didn't
budge: pre = post = 0.000, same as Run-1. With baseline still
collapsed at 0.000, GEPA's reflective mutator has no positive signal
to gradient against, and every one of the 109 proposed mutations
scored 0.0 → was correctly skipped. The +0.000 lift is the honest
answer under the v1.0 corpus, irrespective of metric strictness.

**Next sequenced follow-up — rebuild traces against v1.1.** The
forwarded-mail + duplicate-inbound builder filter shipped in
STAQPRO-365 (PR #98, merged 2026-05-15) was *not* applied to the
on-disk `traces/v1.0/` set used here — the SHA-256 in the table above
matches Run-1's, proving the corpus is unchanged. Re-fetch a v1.1
trace set from mailbox1 using the updated `build-trace-set.ts`,
then re-run GEPA against it. If baseline still pins to 0.000 on a
clean corpus, the next lever isn't the metric or the corpus — it's
the target model itself (STAQPRO-342 three-way bake-off).
