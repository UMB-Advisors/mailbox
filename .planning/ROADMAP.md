# Roadmap: MailBox One

## Overview

Four phases, each delivering a coherent capability. Phase 1 establishes the verified hardware and service foundation that everything else depends on — GPU passthrough confirmed, all five containers healthy. Phase 2 builds the complete email processing loop end-to-end: IMAP in, Qwen3 classification, RAG-augmented draft, approval queue, SMTP out — with persona tuning and history ingestion at first boot. Phase 3 hands control to the operator: graduated auto-send, classification correction, OTA updates, and email notifications. Phase 4 completes the dashboard UI as a polished, mobile-responsive appliance interface. Granularity: coarse.

## Milestone ↔ Phase Crosswalk

GSD planning runs on a Phase axis (Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4). Linear runs on an M-axis aligned to ship/customer events (M1 → M2 → M3 → M4). Both axes describe the same scope; this crosswalk lets a reader translate between them.

| M-axis (Linear) | Phase-axis (GSD) | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **M1 — Reference build** | Phase 1 (all of) + Phase 2 plans 02-02, 02-03, 02-04, first-pass 02-07 | DELIVERED |
| **M2 — 2nd-appliance readiness** *(current focus)* | Phase 2 plan 02-07 finish + parallel security track (STAQPRO-130 ✓ delivered, STAQPRO-131 in progress, STAQPRO-116 todo) + STAQPRO-118 reproduce-baseline-on-2nd-appliance | IN PROGRESS |
| **M3 — Customer #2 onboarded** | Phase 2 plan 02-08 (onboarding wizard) + remaining Phase 4 dashboard polish (STAQPRO-146/147) | NOT STARTED |
| **M4 — Phase 2 RAG + edit-to-skill** | Phase 2 plans 02-05 (RAG) + 02-06 (persona) + Phase 3 ops surface (auto-send, notifications, OTA) | NOT STARTED |

The Phase axis describes *what gets built*; the M axis describes *what gets shipped to whom and when*. A phase plan can land before its M-milestone if it's a dependency (e.g. 02-07 PLAN landed in M2 territory but covers M2+M3 capability). When in doubt, treat Phase as the build artifact and M as the customer-facing checkpoint.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

- [x] **Phase 1: Infrastructure Foundation** - Verified Docker Compose stack with GPU inference confirmed, all five services healthy on Jetson Orin Nano Super (smoke test 6/6 PASS, 2026-04-26)
- [ ] **Phase 2: Email Pipeline Core** - Complete end-to-end email loop: IMAP ingestion, classification, RAG-augmented drafting, approval queue, SMTP send, persona tuning at first boot (in progress: 02-02/03/04a/04b done; 02-07 PLAN promoted with local path shipped; 02-05/06/08 v2 stubs await promotion)
- [ ] **Phase 3: Operator Trust and Reliability** - Graduated auto-send, classification correction, OTA updates, email notifications, graceful degradation
- [ ] **Phase 4: Dashboard and Hardening** - Full dashboard UI with approval queue, history logs, knowledge base management, system status, mobile-responsive, auth

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Foundation
**Goal**: The Jetson Orin Nano Super runs all five services with GPU inference verified and the appliance boots to fully operational in under 3 minutes
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: INFRA-01, INFRA-02, INFRA-03, INFRA-04, INFRA-05, INFRA-06, INFRA-07, INFRA-08, INFRA-09, INFRA-11, INFRA-12
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Jetson boots headless into JetPack 6.2, `docker compose up` brings all five services to healthy within 3 minutes
  2. `docker run --rm --runtime nvidia nvidia-smi` confirms GPU passthrough; Ollama reports `num_gpu_layers > 0` for Qwen3-4B
  3. Qwen3-4B generates a test completion in under 5 seconds; nomic-embed-text returns embeddings on request
  4. Qdrant starts without jemalloc ARM64 errors; Postgres persists data across a container restart
  5. Power mode set to MAXN (25W) at boot via systemd; NVMe encrypted with LUKS
**Plans**: 3 plans (all complete)
Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Docker Compose stack, env template, Postgres schema init, dashboard placeholder
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — First-boot checkpoint script (JetPack validation through compose start)
- [x] 01-03-PLAN.md — Smoke test script (all success criteria + boot time verification — 6/6 passing 2026-04-26)

### Phase 2: Email Pipeline Core
**Goal**: A real inbound email flows from IMAP through classification and RAG-augmented drafting into an approval queue, and the approved draft sends via SMTP from the customer's address — with persona extracted from sent history at first boot
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: MAIL-01, MAIL-02, MAIL-03, MAIL-04, MAIL-05, MAIL-06, MAIL-07, MAIL-08, MAIL-09, MAIL-10, MAIL-11, MAIL-12, MAIL-13, MAIL-14, RAG-01, RAG-02, RAG-03, RAG-04, RAG-05, RAG-06, PERS-01, PERS-02, PERS-03, PERS-04, PERS-05, ONBR-01, ONBR-02, ONBR-03, ONBR-04, ONBR-05, ONBR-06, APPR-01, APPR-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. An email arriving in the connected Gmail inbox appears in the approval queue within 90 seconds, classified into one of the 8 CPG categories with a confidence score
  2. Classification accuracy on a 100-email Heron Labs test set exceeds 80%; `<think>` tokens are stripped and invalid JSON falls back to "unknown" without crashing the pipeline
  3. Each draft shows its source label (Local / Qwen3 or Cloud / Claude Haiku), top-3 RAG context references, and the draft reflects the operator's voice extracted from sent history
  4. Approving a draft in the queue sends it from the customer's SMTP address; rejecting a draft discards it; complex emails queue with "awaiting cloud" status when the API is unreachable
  5. First-boot wizard connects email, ingests 6 months of sent history with a progress indicator, and surfaces a persona tuning session with 20 sample drafts before live email begins
**Plans**: 8 plans (5 complete, 1 partial, 1 plan-promoted with local path shipped, 2 v2 stubs pending plan-promotion)
Plans:
- [x] 02-01-dashboard-backend-bootstrap-PLAN.md — **SUPERSEDED 2026-04-27** by Next.js full-stack ADR (architectural pivot — Express backend retired in favor of Next.js API routes); never executed.
- [x] 02-02-schema-foundation-PLAN-v2-2026-04-27.md — 6 forward-only SQL migrations applied to live Postgres + types/queries shipped 2026-04-27. v1 marked SUPERSEDED.
- [~] 02-03-imap-ingestion-watchdog — **PARTIAL** (2026-04-28). Schema migration 007 + Gmail+Schedule workflow extension shipped against the v2 STUB intent; IMAP-trigger + watchdog architecture rendered moot per D-30. See SUMMARY. v1 + v2 STUB marked SUPERSEDED.
- [x] 02-04-classification-routing — **SPLIT into 02-04a + 02-04b**. Both complete; meta-SUMMARY at `02-04-classification-routing-SUMMARY.md`. v1 + v2 STUB marked SUPERSEDED.
  - [x] 02-04a (MAIL-05 classifier + classify sub-workflow + live-gate stub, 2026-04-29)
  - [x] 02-04b (corpus + scoring + D-50 + MAIL-08 gate PASS, 2026-04-30)
- [ ] 02-05-rag-ingest-retrieval — v2 STUB authoritative; awaits stub-promotion to full executable PLAN. v1 marked SUPERSEDED.
- [ ] 02-06-persona-extract-refresh — v2 STUB authoritative; awaits stub-promotion to full executable PLAN. v1 marked SUPERSEDED.
- [~] 02-07-draft-generation-local-cloud-smtp-PLAN.md — **PLAN PROMOTED 2026-04-30**. Local path shipped end-to-end (commits 001a6bd → d448972, smoke 3.57s p95). Cloud path scaffolded; awaits `OLLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY` and STAQPRO-156 cloud-vendor decision (Anthropic Haiku 4.5 vs Ollama Cloud / gpt-oss:120b — D-52 pending).
- [ ] 02-08-onboarding-wizard-and-queue-api — v2 STUB authoritative; awaits stub-promotion to full executable PLAN. Gated on M2 security track (STAQPRO-131, STAQPRO-116). v1 marked SUPERSEDED.

**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 3: Operator Trust and Reliability
**Goal**: The operator has graduated auto-send controls they can unlock per category, visibility into classification accuracy over time, OTA updates with rollback, email notifications, and the pipeline handles outages without data loss
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: APPR-03, APPR-04, APPR-05, APPR-06, NOTF-01, NOTF-02, INFRA-10
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Auto-send is OFF by default for all categories; the operator can enable it per category after observing accuracy, and correctly classified emails at threshold confidence send without entering the queue
  2. The dashboard shows daily/weekly send volume, pending queue count, and time-in-queue per draft; the operator can view and correct any classification to improve accuracy over time
  3. An OTA update can be triggered from the dashboard; the previous image is retained on-device and can be rolled back if the post-update health check fails
  4. The operator receives an email alert when the queue exceeds the configured threshold, and a daily digest summarizing received/drafted/sent/pending/escalated counts
**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 4: Dashboard and Hardening
**Goal**: The dashboard is a complete, mobile-responsive appliance interface accessible at http://device.local:3000 — approval queue, history logs, knowledge base, persona settings, system status, and authentication all functional from a phone on the same Wi-Fi
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Requirements**: DASH-01, DASH-02, DASH-03, DASH-04, DASH-05, DASH-06, DASH-07, DASH-08, DASH-09, DASH-10
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The dashboard loads at http://device.local:3000 on a phone browser over LAN, requires username/password set during first-boot, and all views render correctly at mobile viewport
  2. The approval queue shows pending drafts with original email, draft text, confidence score, source label (Local/Cloud), and approve/edit/reject/escalate actions
  3. Sent history, classification log, and knowledge base management (upload PDF/DOCX/CSV, view, remove) are all accessible and functional
  4. The system status view shows uptime, email connection health, model status, disk usage, queue depth, and API cost meter — all reflecting live appliance state
**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes
